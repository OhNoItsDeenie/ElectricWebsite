      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>DD electric is a locally owned business that does electrical work on residential and
        commercial buildings in the east side of Michigan.
      </p>
      <p>
        DD electrics was recently made by a master electrician that has been in the industry for 20
        years. The small company currently only has a couple of people working in it, but with
        experience with both homes and businesses in rural and urban areas, they are reliable and
        will get the job done. They do work from downtown Detroit to Flint, and since they are
        based only in Michigan, they are familiar with all of the inspections and paperwork to make
        sure your building is up to code with Michigan law.</p>
        <h2>We have Full insurance and Contracting Licenses!</h2>
